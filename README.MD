## Image Compressor Project:
--
Implemented image Haar Wavelet compression algorithm using Java. The application compressed images with different compression ratios and reduced image size accordingly.
--
Haar wavelet compression is an efficient way to perform both lossless and lossy image compression. It relies
on averaging and differencing values in an image matrix to produce a matrix which is sparse or nearly sparse.

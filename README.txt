When I set different compression ratio for an image, the visual and file size differences are merely detectable when the ratio is under 40%. However, when compression ratio goes up continuously, the visual differences and file size are more obvious. We can clealy tell that the compressed image is more blur than the orignal one. And when increase compression ratio from 90% - 99%, the file size decrease much more sharply than increasing the compression ratio from 40% - 50%.

The compression ratio that I would like to use is around 70 % - 80%, the range of which keeps the most of the details of original image, and it can hardly detect differences visiually although it has been compressed.
